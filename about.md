I'm Shawn Anastasio, a hobbyist developer and security enthusiast.
Most of my projects involve developing Free and Open Source software and
tinkering with computers at a low level, such as my x86
operating system [ShawnOS](https://github.com/shawnanastasio/ShawnOS).

I prefer to do most of my programming in procedural languages (such as C), but
I also have experience in Object-Oriented languages like Java, such as my project
[HashcatDistribute](https://github.com/shawnanastasio/HashcatDistribute): a
program designed to distribute a hash cracking workload across multiple nodes
through a centralized server architecture.
